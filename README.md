# Excel-Projects
This contains projects I have handled with Microsoft excel with real data
Tools & Features Used in This Excel Dashboard Project:
1. Pivot Tables
Used to summarize large datasets and quickly calculate totals such as sales revenue, cost, and profit by different dimensions (e.g., category, month, country, payment method). Pivot Tables are the backbone of this dashboard.

2. Pivot Charts
Built directly from Pivot Tables to create dynamic visualizations. These include:

Clustered column charts (for revenue, cost, and profit comparisons)

Pie chart (for payment method breakdown)

Line and bar charts (for time-based trends)

3. Slicers
Interactive filters that allow users to quickly segment and explore data by:

Month

Year

Product Category

Country

These slicers are connected to multiple Pivot Tables to enable seamless interactivity.

4. Conditional Formatting
Applied to KPIs (e.g., Sales Revenue, Total Cost, Net Profit) to highlight key figures and make the most important numbers stand out visually.

5. Map Chart
Shows geographical revenue distribution by country, offering a clear view of regional sales performance using a heatmap-style visualization.

6. Form Controls & Layout
Buttons, labels, and consistent formatting are used to organize visuals clearly and professionally, enhancing readability and user experience.

7. Dashboard Design Principles
The layout follows best practices:

KPI cards at the top for quick insights

Charts organized by theme (category, geography, time, status)

Clean, uncluttered design with visual hierarchy
